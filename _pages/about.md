Hello! I am a Research Assistant at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en) in Barcelona (Spain), working at the [ViRVIG](https://www.virvig.eu/) research group.

My research interests are **computer animation**, **virtual and augmented reality**, **deep learning** and **computer graphics**.

Currently, I am working in **data-driven character animation**, in particular, motion understanding and synthesis, retargeting, inverse kinematics, motion capture and virtual reality avatars. 

I received my M.Sc. in Computer Graphics and B.S. in Computer Science at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en).
